# Shortcuts

I won't use StreamDeck to trigger keyboard shortcuts, varies of reasons, not because it's not good, it's total personal choices.

I will mostly use macOS default shortcuts and maybe some customized defined by System's Keyboard shortcuts or Alfred.

### Single keys

I use single key to activate or open an application, defined in Alfred workflow.

### Finder

- `⇧⌘H`: Home
- `⇧⌘A`: Application
- `⇧⌘O`: Documents
- `⇧⌘D`: Desktop
- `⇧⌘G`: Go to Folder
- `⌘[`: Back(same to Chromium)
- `⌘]`: Forward(same to Chromium)
- `⌥⌘L`: Downloads

### VSCode

- `F1`: I can't live without it.
- `⌃W`: Switch window, occasionally I open multiple projects(windows), some in full screen and some not, so the `⌃F4` won't works if some window is full screen, this is super handy.

### Windows Management

I put Macbook at left and Studio Display at right.

🧩 Means custom, from System's Keyboard Shortcuts -> App Shortcuts.

- `⌃⇧→`: 🧩 Tile Window to Right of Screen

- `⌃⌥←`: 🧩 Move Window to Left Side of Screen
- `⌃⌥⇧→`: 🧩 Move to Studio Display
- `⌃⌥⇧←`: 🧩 Move to Built-in Retina Display
- `⌃⌘F` or `🌐F`: Toggle Full Screen
- ⌘\`: Move focus to next window(of same application)
- `⌃F4`: Move focus to active or next window
