# Shortcuts

I won't use StreamDeck to trigger keyboard shortcuts, varies of reasons, not because it's not good, it's total personal choices.

I will mostly use macOS default shortcuts and maybe some customized defined by System's Keyboard shortcuts or Alfred.

### Single keys

I use single key to activate or open an application, defined in Alfred workflow.

Tips: Set the trigger behaviour to **Pass through modifier keys**, will trigger immediately

### VSCode

- `F1`: I can't live without it.
- `⌃W`: Switch window, occasionally I open multiple projects(windows), some in full screen and some not, so the `⌃F4` won't works if some window is full screen, this is super handy.
- Remove: `cursorWordPartLeft` and `cursorWordPartRight` which will conflict with below custom shortcuts

### Windows Management

I put Macbook at left and Studio Display at right.

I am not using Stage Manager because didn't managed how to use it properly.
